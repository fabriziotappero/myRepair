A web app to elegantly solve motorbike fleet repears.

### Frontend

All styling is done in [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) and all icons are from [Boxicon](https://boxicons.com/). Javascript is kept to a minimum with [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here). Future versions of this app will use [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) running somewhere.

If Pico CSS is not enough, you can fold back to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Backend
 
[Golang](https://golang.org/) is the preferred language here but for for the first 
prototyping we are goind to use the great [PoketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) hosted on the fanstatic [Pokethost.io](https://app.pockethost.io/).

### Tools and Stuff
VsCode extension Live Server Preview and nothing more.
