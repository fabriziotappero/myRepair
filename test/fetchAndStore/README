This is a simple example of a JS script that pull data from the open database on jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and write it to a locally running PocketBase database.

Note that to write staff in the local database, the script needs to login as an admin.

Start poketbase locally:

    poketbase serve

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/ create a user, login and create a new collection named *posts*:

Add fields to match the JSONPlaceholder post structure:

    userId (number)
    title (text)
    body (text)

Run the cron script to fetch and store data locally every minute:

    npm init-y
    npm install axios node-cron pocketbase
    node fetchAndStore.js

You can use getToken.html to get the token from your backend.
